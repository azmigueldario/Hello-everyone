# Hello everyone

### _My personal repository_ 

My name is Miguel Prieto, my background is in medicine (MD) and health sciences researcher (neglected diseases) for almost 5 years. Currently I am a grad student at UBC in Vancouver, Canada; here I work with cystic fibrosis.  
Currently, I am starting to work in-depth with bioinformatics: I have some experience in R / Bioconductor, but I want to improve my skills as well as get familiar with the  command line.
